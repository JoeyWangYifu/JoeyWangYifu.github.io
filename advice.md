## How to land a internship in a shitty job market?

- **Luck**: Unless you are a math wizard with Math Olympic Gold medal, then you definitely need some luck. Is the interview question is what you plan to face? Do the interviewer having a bad day today? Do you apear likeable today? Don't hang on to the result too much, move on to next interview, things just work out (I hope?)
- **Do your homework**: People underestimate the importance of preparation. You absolutely can pass interview if you are truly good at what you learn, but if you are not that smart like me and go thorugh the classic question and past interview question other posted online, you'd be surprised how lazy those company can be using the same question. Below is the resources you must finish before going to interview
  - a practical guide to quantitative finance interviews (The one and only green bible for quant interview)
  - 1Point3Acres/Glassdoor (Almost like cheating!)
- **Communication**: Sometime I read post someone complain about how the candidate only throw out a answer and back to silence. Interview is not merely a process of checking if you are smart enough to get the answer, but also whether you are nice enough to work with. How you deliver the answer matters, you will present your work to the interviewer at work, knowing how to deliver a idea smoothly to people is just as important as coming up with the idea. If you cannot figure out how to better communicate during interview, just try to explain the question to people has no background knowledge. If you can make them follow you, you are clearly good to convince the interviewer.
